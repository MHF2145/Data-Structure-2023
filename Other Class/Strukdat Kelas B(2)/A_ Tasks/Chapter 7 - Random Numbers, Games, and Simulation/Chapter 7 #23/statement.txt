A gambler pays $5 to play the following game. He throws two six-sided dice. If the sum of 
the two numbers thrown is even, he loses his bet. If the sum is odd, he draws a card from 
a standard pack of 52 playing cards. If he draws an ace, 3, 5, 7 or 9, he is paid the value of 
the card plus $5 (an ace counts as 1). If he draws any other card, he loses. Write a program 
to simulate the playing of 20 games and print the average amount won by the gambler 
per game.
