A data file contains registration information for six coursesâ€”CS20A, CS21A, CS29A, CS30A, 
CS35A, and CS36A. Each line of data consists of a seven-digit student registration number 
followed by six (ordered) values, each of which is 0 or 1. A value of 1 indicates that the 
student is registered for the corresponding course; 0 means the student is not. Thus, 
1 0 1 0 1 1 means that the student is registered for CS20A, CS29A, CS35A, and CS36A, 
but not for CS21A and CS30A. You may assume that there are no more than 100 students 
and a registration number 0 ends the data. Write a program to read the data and produce 
a class list for each course. Each list consists of the registration numbers of those students 
taking the course
