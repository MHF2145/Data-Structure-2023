At a school’s bazaar, activities were divided into stalls. At the close of the bazaar, the manager 
of each stall submitted information to the principal consisting of the name of the stall, the 
income earned, and its expenses. Here’s some sample data:

    Games 2300.00 1000.00
    Sweets 900.00 1000.00

Using a structure to hold a stall’s data, write a program to read the data and print a report 
consisting of the stall name and net income (income - expenses), in order of decreasing 
net income (that is, with the most profitable stall first and the least profitable stall last). 
In addition, print the number of stalls, the total profit or loss of the bazaar, and the stall(s) 
that made the most profit. Assume that a line containing xxxxxx only ends the data.
